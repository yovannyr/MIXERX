*Generated on 2025-10-02 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [epcc](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/epcc)*

## Goal
Implement audio metering (VU meters) for monitoring master output levels - essential for preventing clipping and maintaining proper levels.

## Explore

### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [x] Development workflow started

### Tasks

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file

## Plan

### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [x] Requirements clear

### Implementation Strategy

**Approach:** Create AudioMeter class for peak and RMS level detection.

**Design:**
- Peak level detection (instant)
- RMS level detection (average)
- Decay for smooth meter movement
- Per-channel metering (L/R)
- dB scale output
