# Development Plan: MIXERX (main branch)

*Generated on 2025-10-02 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [epcc](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/epcc)*

## Goal
Implement improved time-stretch algorithm with keylock (pitch-independent tempo control) for professional DJ functionality.

## Explore

### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [x] Development workflow started

### Tasks

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Current time-stretch is simple linear interpolation
- [x] Need better algorithm for quality

## Plan

### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [x] Requirements clear

### Implementation Strategy

**Approach:** Implement WSOLA (Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add) algorithm - simpler than phase vocoder, better than linear interpolation.

**Design:**
- WSOLA for time-stretch
- Maintains pitch while changing tempo
- Window-based processing
- Cross-correlation for best overlap
- Quality: Good enough for DJ use

### Tasks

### Completed
- [x] Choose algorithm (WSOLA)

## Code

### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [x] Plan complete

### Tasks
- [ ] Create Audio/TimeStretchEngine.cs
- [ ] Implement WSOLA algorithm
- [ ] Replace simple interpolation in Deck
- [ ] Build and verify

### Completed
*None yet*

## Commit

### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [ ] Time-stretch implemented
- [ ] Build successful

### Tasks

### Completed
*None yet*

## Key Decisions

### Algorithm Choice: WSOLA
- Simpler than phase vocoder
- Better quality than linear interpolation
- Good for DJ use (tempo range 0.5x-2.0x)
- No external dependencies needed

## Notes
*Additional context and observations*
