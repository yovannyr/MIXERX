# Development Plan: MIXERX (main branch)

*Generated on 2025-10-02 by Vibe Feature MCP*
*Workflow: [epcc](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/epcc)*

## Goal
Implement 3-band EQ (Low/Mid/High) for DJ mixing - essential feature for professional audio control per deck.

## Explore

### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [x] Development workflow started
- [x] Initial goal defined

### Tasks

### Completed
- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Review existing Effects architecture (IEffect, EffectChain)
- [x] Research EQ filter types (shelving, peaking)
- [x] Define EQ frequency ranges (Low: <250Hz, Mid: 250Hz-4kHz, High: >4kHz)
- [x] Check how effects integrate with Deck

**Finding:** EQEffect already exists in EffectChain.cs but uses simplified biquad approximation. Needs proper implementation.

## Plan

### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [x] Effects architecture understood
- [x] EQ requirements defined
- [x] Filter design approach clear

### Implementation Strategy

**Approach:** Extract EQEffect to separate file with proper biquad filters.

**Design:**
- Low shelf filter @ 250Hz (boost/cut bass)
- Peaking filter @ 1kHz (boost/cut mids)
- High shelf filter @ 4kHz (boost/cut treble)
- Gain range: 0.0 (kill) to 2.0 (boost)
- Proper biquad coefficients for 48kHz sample rate

**Changes:**
1. Create `Effects/EQEffect.cs` with proper implementation
2. Remove EQEffect stub from EffectChain.cs
3. Keep it minimal - just the essential EQ functionality

### Tasks

### Completed
- [x] Define EQ filter design
- [x] Plan file structure

## Code

### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [x] Implementation plan complete
- [x] Design approved

### Tasks

### Completed
- [x] Create Effects/EQEffect.cs with proper biquad filters
- [x] Remove EQEffect stub from EffectChain.cs
- [x] Build and verify
- [x] Proper 3-band EQ with low shelf, peaking, high shelf filters

## Commit

### Phase Entrance Criteria
- [x] EQ implemented
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] Code ready

### Tasks

### Completed
**STEP 1: Code Cleanup**
- [x] No debug output
- [x] No TODO/FIXME
- [x] Clean code

**STEP 2: Documentation Review**
- [x] No doc updates needed (EQ is self-contained effect)

**STEP 3: Final Validation**
- [x] Build successful
- [x] Code ready for production
